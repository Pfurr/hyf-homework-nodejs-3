## REST Express Homework
With this homework we would learn how to create a REST server.

We would create a simple counter to understand the details of persistent data.

- Create an endpoint that would answer to `GET` to `/users` with the list of users
- Create an endpoint to `GET` to `/user/:id`
- Create an endpoint to `POST` to `/user/:id`
- Create an endpoint to `DELETE` to `/user/:id`
